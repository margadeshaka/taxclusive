# Understanding Tax Deductions for Small Businesses

Tax deductions are one of the most effective ways for small businesses to reduce their tax burden. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key deductions available to small business owners.

## What Are Tax Deductions?

Tax deductions are expenses that can be subtracted from your business's gross income to reduce the amount of income subject to taxation. Understanding and properly claiming these deductions can significantly impact your bottom line.

### Common Business Deductions

Here are some of the most common tax deductions for small businesses:

1. **Home Office Deduction**
   - Available if you use part of your home regularly and exclusively for business
   - Can be calculated using the simplified method ($5 per square foot) or actual expenses

2. **Vehicle Expenses**
   - Mileage driven for business purposes
   - Actual vehicle expenses (gas, maintenance, insurance)

3. **Office Supplies and Equipment**
   - Computers, software, printers
   - Paper, pens, and other consumables

## Calculating Your Deductions

Here's a simple example of how deductions work:

```javascript
// Example tax calculation
const grossIncome = 100000;
const deductions = {
  homeOffice: 1500,
  vehicleExpenses: 3000,
  officeSupplies: 2000,
  professionalServices: 5000
};

const totalDeductions = Object.values(deductions).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
const taxableIncome = grossIncome - totalDeductions;

console.log(`Taxable Income: $${taxableIncome}`);
// Output: Taxable Income: $88500
```

## Important Considerations

> **Note:** Always keep detailed records and receipts for all business expenses. The IRS may request documentation during an audit.

### Record Keeping Tips

- Use accounting software to track expenses
- Scan and digitally store all receipts
- Maintain a mileage log for vehicle deductions
- Keep records for at least 3-7 years

## Professional Services Deductions
