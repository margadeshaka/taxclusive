# Architecture and Structure Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the tasks from the Architecture and Structure section of the improvement tasks.

## Task 1: Refactor large page components into smaller, reusable components

The home page component (`app/page.tsx`) was refactored from a large monolithic component (597 lines) into smaller, reusable components:

- Created `components/features/home/hero-section.tsx` for the hero section
- Created `components/features/home/services-section.tsx` for the services section
- Created `components/features/home/expertise-section.tsx` for the expertise/industry specializations section
- Created `components/features/home/insights-section.tsx` for the insights section
- Created `components/features/home/contact-section.tsx` for the contact section
- Created `components/features/home/index.ts` to export all home page components
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to use these components

This refactoring improves code maintainability, readability, and reusability. Each component now has a single responsibility and can be maintained independently.

## Task 2: Implement a consistent folder structure for components

Implemented a consistent folder structure for components:

- Created `components/features/` for feature-specific components
- Created `components/shared/` for reusable components that can be used across different features
- Created `components/layouts/` for layout components that define the structure of pages

This structure makes it easier to locate components and understand their purpose and scope.

## Task 3: Create a proper architecture document

Created `docs/architecture.md` to outline the application structure and data flow. The document includes:

- Overview of the application structure
- Description of the component organization
- Explanation of the library structure
- Description of the data flow pattern
- Example of the blog data flow
- Overview of the error handling strategy
- Description of the styling approach

This document serves as a reference for developers working on the project and helps maintain consistency in the codebase.

## Task 4: Organize utility functions in lib/ directory

Organized utility functions in the `lib/` directory into logical categories:

- Created `lib/api/` for API clients and functions for data fetching
  - Moved `strapi.ts` to `lib/api/strapi.ts`
  - Created `lib/api/index.ts` to export API functions
- Created `lib/helpers/` for utility functions for common tasks
  - Moved `utils.ts` to `lib/helpers/utils.ts`
  - Created `lib/helpers/index.ts` to export helper functions
- Updated `lib/index.ts` to re-export from all subdirectories

This organization makes it easier to locate and use utility functions and improves code maintainability.

## Task 5: Implement proper error boundary components

Implemented an error boundary component to handle runtime errors gracefully:

- Created `components/shared/error-boundary.tsx` to catch and handle runtime errors
- Created `components/shared/index.ts` to export the error boundary component

This component catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

## Task 6: Add TypeScript interfaces for all data models

Added TypeScript interfaces for data models used in the application:

- Created `lib/types/` directory for TypeScript interfaces
- Created `lib/types/blog.ts` with interfaces for blog data models:
  - `BlogMeta`: Interface for blog metadata
  - `BlogAttributes`: Interface for blog attributes
  - `Blog`: Interface for a single blog
  - `BlogListResponse`: Interface for blog list response
  - `BlogResponse`: Interface for single blog response
- Created `lib/types/index.ts` to export all interfaces
- Updated `lib/index.ts` to export types

These interfaces provide type safety and documentation for the data models used in the application.

## Task 7: Create a centralized state management solution

Implemented a centralized state management solution for shared application state:

- Created `lib/context/` directory for React Context providers
- Created `lib/context/blog-context.tsx` with:
  - `BlogContext`: React Context for blog data
  - `useBlogContext`: Custom hook to use the blog context
  - `BlogProvider`: Provider component that wraps the app and makes blog data available
- Created `lib/context/index.ts` to export the blog context
- Updated `lib/index.ts` to export the context

This solution provides a centralized store for application state and makes it easy to share data between components.

## Conclusion

These changes have significantly improved the architecture and structure of the TaxExclusive project. The codebase is now more organized, maintainable, and scalable. The refactoring of large components into smaller, reusable ones, the implementation of a consistent folder structure, and the addition of proper error handling and state management will make it easier to develop and maintain the application in the future.
